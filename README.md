HealthBuddies was inspired by TCNJ's Club, aiming to further its spread and impact on student volunteers and healthcare patients.

# About the Project

## Inspiration
This project was influenced to help a friend out with their club at TCNJ called HealthBuddies by making a website for them.
## What it does?
HealthBuddies provides a platform for students to connect, volunteer, and offer compassionate support to patients in healthcare settings. It fosters a community of peer support and offers resources for personal growth and learning.


## How we built it?
HealthBuddies was built using a combination of web development technologies, including Wordpress, LocalWP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website was designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring a seamless experience for both volunteers and patients.


## Challenges we ran into 
During the development process, we faced challenges such as setting up a mailing system for users to contact us and hosting the website.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Through hard work, teamwork, and collaboration, we overcame this challenges and worked together. Through our teammate's web design and development experience as well as our efforts to research and fix issues and bugs in our software, we made an exceptional website in the end.



## What we learned 
Through the development of HealthBuddies, we learned about the importance of effective communication with healthcare institutions, the significance of privacy and security measures, and the impact of peer support on patients and volunteers. We learned just how much our website could help people in the world.


## What's next for HealthBuddies? 
n the future, we plan to expand HealthBuddies to more healthcare institutions, reaching a larger audience of students and patients. We aim to enhance the platform's features, including online resources, mentorship programs, and virtual support groups on our website as well as further applications in addition to our current mental healthh test/resources, to provide an even more comprehensive and impactful experience.
