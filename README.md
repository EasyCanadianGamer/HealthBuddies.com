A website for a club that supports and helps students in medical field to get experiences in hospitals by being a HealthBuddy volunteer. 

### About the Project

## Inpiration
This project was influenced to help a friend out with their club at TCNJ called HealthBuddies by making a website for them.
## What it does?
This website shows the simple parts of a club with the home page showing the mission of the club, how to join, and the contact information, the events page showing upcoming events for the club, the FAQ page showing commonly asked questions about the club, E-Board page having all the leaders and their contacts such as president, vice president, and training officer. There is only a Mental Health Test page that allows the users to select an input and see if they are sad, happy, depressed, or angry. If any of these inputs are negative emotions ( sad, angry, or depressed) it will return solutions to improve your mental health. 

## How we built it?
We used WordPress to make this a functional website. With the help of Joeseph Giresi, one of our teammates, showed us how to use WordPress, since it was new to us.
